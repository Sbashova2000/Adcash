# Adcash


Hello, how are you? :)

I decided to do the tasks in C++ programming language.
Solution of Task 1 is in Adcash1.cpp file -  test scenarios are commented

You can run the file in Visual Studio Code for example using these comands:
First, open the folder Adcash or give the path to  it and open a new terminal. Then write ,, g++ Adcash1.cpp'' in the terminal
Second, write "./a.exe"


Solution of Task 2 is in Adcash2.cpp file
		              in Adcash2_2.cpp file you can generate a new ,,csv file'' for new test scenarios if you want.

File.csv and items.csv are ready files for  test scenarios.
In items.csv is the given example from task2(with same numbers)

You can run Adcash2.cpp in the same way as Adcash1.cpp(give the path to the file or open the folder) writing these comands:

First:         g++ Adcash2.cpp
Second:        ./a.exe File.csv         or       ./a.exe items.csv



You can run Adcash2_2.cpp file in the same way as Adcash2.cpp and
you have to write  ,,./a.exe File.csv'' where File.csv is the name of the file that you want to run or create.

Have a nice day! :)
